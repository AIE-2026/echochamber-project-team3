# EchoChamber Studio

Simulation of discursive bubbles using political comments.
Each agent responds from the perspective of its own political community.

## Setup

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd echochamber
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env        # then add your API key
```

## Ethics and limitations

EchoChamber is a teaching and research prototype. Its agents are simulated discursive roles, not real people or representatives of real social groups. Generated outputs may contain bias, unsupported claims, or amplified conflict and must be interpreted critically.

See [`docs/ethics_checklist.md`](docs/ethics_checklist.md) for the full ethics note, limitations, and final checklist.
